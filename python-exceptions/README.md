# Python - Exceptions

## Overview
This project is a quick guide on handling exceptions in Python. Exception handling is essential for writing resilient and error-tolerant code.

## Key concept
### Try-Except Block
Use try and except to handle exceptions. Place potentially error-prone code inside the try block and provide the corresponding error-handling logic in the except block.


```python
try:
    # Your code here
except SomeException:
    # Handle the exception
```
### Multiple Except Blocks
You can have multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions separately.

```python
try:
    # Your code here
except SomeException:
    # Handle SomeException
except AnotherException:
    # Handle AnotherException
```
### Else Clause
The else clause is executed if no exceptions are raised in the try block.
```python
try:
    # Your code here
except SomeException:
    # Handle SomeException
else:
    # Code to execute if no exceptions
```

### Finally Clause
The finally block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's useful for cleanup operations.
```python
try:
    # Your code here
except SomeException:
    # Handle SomeException
finally:
    # Cleanup code, always executed
```
### Custom Exceptions
Create custom exceptions to handle specific scenarios in your code.
```python
class CustomException(Exception):
    pass

try:
    # Your code here
except CustomException:
    # Handle CustomException
```
## Best Practices
- Be specific in catching exceptions. Avoid using a generic except clause.
- Keep the try block as short as possible.
- Use meaningful exception names for clarity.
- Handle exceptions at the appropriate level in your code
