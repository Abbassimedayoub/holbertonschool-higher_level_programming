# Python If-Else, Loops, and Functions

This repository provides a basic introduction to Python programming concepts such as if-else statements, loops, and functions. These fundamental concepts are essential for writing structured and efficient Python code.

3. [Functions](#3-functions)

## 1. If-Else Statements

In Python, if-else statements are used to make decisions based on conditions. They allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a given condition is True or False.

### Example:

```python
x = 10

if x > 0:
    print("Positive number")
elif x == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative number")
    
```
## 2. Loops
Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly. Two common types of loops are the for loop and the while loop.
### Example (for loop)
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"Fruit: {fruit}")

```
### Example (while loop)

```python
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1
```
## 3. Functions
Functions allow you to organize your code into reusable blocks. They take parameters, perform specific tasks, and can return values.
### Example
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(f"Sum: {result}")
```
Feel free to explore the provided examples and modify the code according to your requirements. Understanding these basic concepts is crucial for building more complex Python programs.

Happy coding!
